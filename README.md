This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

When Grafbase launched, we offered a built-in, serverless database as core part of the product. Building a backend is hard and time consuming, and we wanted to make it as easy as possible for developers to deploy a GraphQL API with a database without worrying about infrastructure. We will be sunsetting the Grafbase database on December 15, 2023. This means that the Grafbase database will continue to work until then, but we will not be adding any new features or fixing any major bugs. We will also be removing full-text search functionality, which is coupled to the database, on that date. [For more details.](https://grafbase.com/changelog/sunsetting-the-grafbase-database)
